For example, the time dimension would contain every hour, day, week, month, quarter and year that has occurred since you started your business operations. Product dimension could contain a name and description of products you sell, their unit price, color, weight and other attributes as applicable. Attributes would be a customerâ€™s first and last name, age, gender etc.</p>
